<h1>Hungry Snake using Java Swing</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Java with the help of Swing and AWT libraries. The game allows players to control a snake and collect food items to increase their score. When the snake collides with the game borders or itself, the game ends, and the player can restart it by pressing the spacebar.
How to Play

    Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
    Move the snake to collect the orange food items to increase your score.
    Avoid colliding with the game borders or the snake's own body.
    When the game ends, press the spacebar to restart.
