How to Play

    Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

    Avoid colliding with the game borders or the snake's own body.
    When the game ends, press the spacebar to restart.

    GamePanel: This class represents the game's panel, where the game logic, graphics, and user interactions are handled. It contains methods for controlling the snake, checking for collisions, and drawing the game components.

#How to Run

    Compile the source files.
